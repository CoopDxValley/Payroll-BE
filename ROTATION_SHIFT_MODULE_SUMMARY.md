# Rotation Shift Module - Complete Implementation Summary

## Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive **Rotation Shift Module** for your payroll system. This module provides complete management of rotating shift schedules and employee shift assignments with DAY/NIGHT/OFF patterns.

## What Has Been Created

### 1. **Complete Module Structure**
```
src/modules/rotationShift/
â”œâ”€â”€ rotationShift.service.ts      # Business logic and database operations
â”œâ”€â”€ rotationShift.controller.ts   # HTTP request handlers
â”œâ”€â”€ rotationShift.validation.ts   # Input validation schemas
â”œâ”€â”€ rotationShift.route.ts        # API route definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ rotationShift.type.ts         # TypeScript type definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ rotationShift.index.ts        # Module exports
â””â”€â”€ README.md                     # Comprehensive documentation
```

### 2. **Database Models** (Already in your schema)
- `ShiftSchedule` - Groups shifts over date ranges
- `EmployeeShiftAssignment` - Daily shift assignments
- `RotatingShiftType` enum (DAY, NIGHT, OFF)

### 3. **API Endpoints** (Base: `/rotation-shifts`)

#### Shift Schedule Management
- `POST /schedules` - Create new schedule
- `GET /schedules` - Get all schedules with filters
- `GET /schedules/:id` - Get specific schedule
- `PATCH /schedules/:id` - Update schedule
- `POST /schedules/:id/approve` - Approve schedule
- `DELETE /schedules/:id` - Delete schedule

#### Employee Shift Assignment Management
- `POST /assignments` - Create assignment
- `GET /assignments` - Get assignments with filters
- `PATCH /assignments/:id` - Update assignment
- `POST /assignments/:id/approve` - Approve assignment
- `DELETE /assignments/:id` - Delete assignment

#### Bulk Operations
- `POST /assignments/bulk` - Create multiple assignments
- `GET /employees/:employeeId/summary` - Get rotation summary

## Key Features

### âœ… **Shift Schedule Management**
- Create schedules for specific date ranges
- Prevent overlapping schedules
- Approval workflow (lock once approved)
- Company-scoped operations

### âœ… **Employee Assignments**
- Assign DAY/NIGHT/OFF shifts to employees
- One assignment per employee per day
- Automatic hours calculation (DAY/NIGHT = 12h, OFF = 0h)
- Link assignments to schedules (optional)

### âœ… **Bulk Operations**
- Create up to 100 assignments at once
- Validation of all inputs before processing
- Conflict prevention

### âœ… **Comprehensive Reporting**
- Employee rotation summaries
- Working hours calculation
- Shift type breakdowns

### âœ… **Business Rules & Validation**
- No overlapping schedules
- Date range validation
- Company isolation
- Approval state management

## Integration Points

### 1. **Main Router Registration**
- Added to `src/routes/v1/index.ts`
- Available at `/rotation-shifts` endpoint
- Integrated with existing authentication middleware

### 2. **Existing Module Integration**
- Works with your existing `Shift` model
- Integrates with `Employee` and `Company` models
- Uses existing authentication and validation systems

### 3. **Database Schema**
- Leverages your existing Prisma schema
- No additional database migrations needed
- Proper indexing for performance

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Weekly Rotation Schedule

```typescript
// 1. Create schedule
const schedule = await rotationShiftService.createShiftSchedule({
  companyId: "company-uuid",
  name: "Security Week 1",
  startDate: new Date("2025-08-01"),
  endDate: new Date("2025-08-07"),
});

// 2. Bulk create assignments
await rotationShiftService.bulkCreateAssignments({
  scheduleId: schedule.id,
  assignments: [
    { employeeId: "emp1", date: "2025-08-01", rotatingShiftType: "DAY" },
    { employeeId: "emp1", date: "2025-08-02", rotatingShiftType: "DAY" },
    { employeeId: "emp1", date: "2025-08-03", rotatingShiftType: "NIGHT" },
    { employeeId: "emp1", date: "2025-08-04", rotatingShiftType: "NIGHT" },
    { employeeId: "emp1", date: "2025-08-05", rotatingShiftType: "OFF" },
    { employeeId: "emp1", date: "2025-08-06", rotatingShiftType: "OFF" },
    { employeeId: "emp1", date: "2025-08-07", rotatingShiftType: "DAY" },
  ],
  companyId: "company-uuid",
});

// 3. Approve schedule
await rotationShiftService.approveShiftSchedule(schedule.id, "company-uuid");
```

### Getting Employee Summary

```typescript
const summary = await rotationShiftService.getEmployeeRotationSummary(
  "employee-uuid",
  "company-uuid",
  new Date("2025-08-01"),
  new Date("2025-08-31")
);

console.log(`Total hours: ${summary.totalHours}`);
console.log(`Day shifts: ${summary.dayShifts}, Night shifts: ${summary.nightShifts}`);
```

## API Request Examples

### Create Shift Schedule
```http
POST /rotation-shifts/schedules
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Security August 2025 Week 1",
  "startDate": "2025-08-01T00:00:00Z",
  "endDate": "2025-08-07T23:59:59Z"
}
```

### Create Employee Assignment
```http
POST /rotation-shifts/assignments
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "employeeId": "uuid",
  "scheduleId": "uuid",
  "date": "2025-08-01T00:00:00Z",
  "rotatingShiftType": "DAY"
}
```

### Bulk Create Assignments
```http
POST /rotation-shifts/assignments/bulk
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "scheduleId": "uuid",
  "assignments": [
    {
      "employeeId": "uuid1",
      "date": "2025-08-01T00:00:00Z",
      "rotatingShiftType": "DAY"
    },
    {
      "employeeId": "uuid1",
      "date": "2025-08-02T00:00:00Z",
      "rotatingShiftType": "NIGHT"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Business Rules Implemented

### 1. **Schedule Rules**
- **Shift Required**: All schedules must be linked to a ROTATING shift
- **ROTATING Shift Only**: Only shifts with shiftType "ROTATING" can be used
- No overlapping schedules in same date range
- Start date must be before end date
- Cannot modify/delete approved schedules
- Company-scoped operations

### 2. **Assignment Rules**
- One assignment per employee per day
- Assignment dates must be within schedule range (if linked)
- Cannot modify/delete approved assignments
- Automatic hours calculation

### 3. **Bulk Operation Rules**
- Maximum 100 assignments per operation
- All employees must belong to same company
- No conflicts with existing assignments

## Security Features

- **Company Isolation**: All operations scoped to authenticated user's company
- **Authentication Required**: All endpoints require valid JWT token
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation using Zod schemas
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Uses Prisma ORM with parameterized queries

## Performance Features

- **Database Indexes**: Optimized queries on companyId, dates, employeeId
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient bulk assignment creation
- **Selective Loading**: Only load necessary related data
- **Eager Loading**: Optimized database queries

## Error Handling

The module provides comprehensive error handling for:
- Validation errors (invalid data format, missing fields)
- Business rule violations (overlapping schedules, duplicate assignments)
- Permission errors (company context missing, access denied)
- State errors (modifying approved schedules/assignments)
- Not found errors (invalid IDs, missing resources)

## Testing the Module

### 1. **Start your server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. **Test endpoints**
- Use Postman or similar tool
- Include valid JWT token in Authorization header
- Test with your company context

### 3. **Sample test sequence**
1. Create a shift schedule
2. Create employee assignments
3. Bulk create assignments
4. Get assignments with filters
5. Approve schedule
6. Get employee summary

## Next Steps

### 1. **Database Migration** (if needed)
```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

### 2. **Testing**
- Test all endpoints with valid data
- Test error scenarios
- Test business rule validations

### 3. **Integration**
- Integrate with your frontend
- Add any additional business logic
- Customize validation rules if needed

### 4. **Monitoring**
- Add logging for important operations
- Monitor performance metrics
- Set up error tracking

## Support

The module is fully documented with:
- Comprehensive README with examples
- TypeScript type definitions
- Input validation schemas
- Error handling patterns
- Business rule documentation

All code follows your existing patterns and integrates seamlessly with your current system architecture.
